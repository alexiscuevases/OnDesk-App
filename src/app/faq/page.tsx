			{
				question: "What is AgentHub?",
				answer: "AgentHub is an AI-powered customer engagement platform that allows you to create, deploy, and manage intelligent AI agents that interact with your customers across multiple channels including WhatsApp, website chat widgets, and more. Our platform makes it easy to automate customer support, sales, and engagement without requiring technical expertise.",
			},
			{
				question: "How do I create my first AI agent?",
				answer: "Creating your first AI agent is simple! After signing up, navigate to the Agents section in your dashboard and click 'Create Agent'. You'll be guided through a step-by-step process where you can name your agent, define its purpose, customize its personality with prompts, and choose which AI model to use. Once created, you can immediately start testing and deploying it to your preferred channels.",
			},
			{
				question: "Do I need coding knowledge to use AgentHub?",
				answer: "No coding knowledge is required! AgentHub is designed to be user-friendly for everyone. Our intuitive interface allows you to create and customize AI agents using simple forms and prompts. However, if you're a developer, we also offer advanced features and API access for deeper customization.",
			},
			{
				question: "How long does it take to set up?",
				answer: "You can have your first AI agent up and running in less than 10 minutes. The basic setup involves creating an account, configuring your first agent with a prompt, and connecting it to a channel like your website or WhatsApp. More advanced configurations and integrations can be added as you grow.",
			},
		],
	},
	{
		category: "Features & Capabilities",
		questions: [
			{
				question: "What channels can I connect my AI agents to?",
				answer: "AgentHub supports multiple channels including WhatsApp Business, website chat widgets, SMS, and email. You can deploy the same agent across all channels or create specialized agents for different platforms. We're constantly adding new channel integrations based on customer feedback.",
			},
			{
				question: "Can I customize my AI agent's personality and responses?",
				answer: "You have full control over your agent's personality through custom prompts and system instructions. You can define the tone (professional, friendly, casual), set specific knowledge bases, create custom responses for common scenarios, and even train your agent on your company's specific data and policies.",
			},
			{
				question: "How many conversations can my agent handle simultaneously?",
				answer: "Your AI agents can handle unlimited simultaneous conversations. Unlike human agents who can only manage a few conversations at once, AI agents can engage with thousands of customers simultaneously without any degradation in response quality or speed.",
			},
			{
				question: "Does AgentHub support multiple languages?",
				answer: "Yes! Our AI agents support over 50 languages and can automatically detect and respond in the customer's preferred language. This makes it easy to provide global customer support without hiring multilingual staff.",
			},

	{
		category: "Pricing & Plans",
		questions: [
			{
				question: "What's included in the free trial?",

			},
			{
				question: "Can I change my plan later?",
				answer: "Yes, you can upgrade or downgrade your plan at any time. When you upgrade, you'll immediately get access to the new features. When you downgrade, the changes will take effect at the end of your current billing cycle, and you'll retain access to premium features until then.",
			},
			{
				question: "What happens if I exceed my plan limits?",
				answer: "If you approach your plan limits, we'll send you notifications. If you exceed your conversation limit, your agents will continue working, but you'll be prompted to upgrade to a higher plan. We never abruptly stop your serviceâ€”we want to ensure your customers always receive support.",
			},
			{
				question: "Do you offer discounts for annual billing?",
				answer: "Yes! Annual billing comes with a 20% discount compared to monthly billing. You'll also get priority support and early access to new features. Enterprise customers can contact our sales team for custom pricing and additional discounts.",
			},
		],

	{
		category: "Security & Privacy",
		questions: [
			{
				question: "How secure is my data?",

Our infrastructure is hosted on enterprise-grade cloud providers with 99.9% uptime SLA. We conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.",
			},
			{
				question: "Who has access to my conversation data?",
				answer: "Only you and your authorized team members have access to your conversation data. AgentHub employees do not access your data unless you explicitly grant permission for support purposes. We never sell or share your data with third parties. You maintain full ownership of all your data.",
			},
			{
				question: "Can I export my data?",

			},
			{
				question: "Are you GDPR and CCPA compliant?",
				answer: "Yes, we're fully compliant with GDPR, CCPA, and other major data protection regulations. We provide tools to help you manage customer data rights, including data deletion requests, data portability, and consent management. Our privacy policy clearly outlines how we handle data.",
